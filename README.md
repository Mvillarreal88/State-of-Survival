**Data Clean Up**

Examined data from 2001 -2011 for physical activity and obesity rates, as well as life expectancy from 1985-2010.
Sorted states by averages per counties to examine trends for changes in life expectancy to create heat map. 
Graphics created by regions, state, counties, and gender.
